# Farewell from our President

## September 5, 2022

I would like to thank everyone who made the summer show a great success! We had a wonderful turnout this year with many great activities for visitors to enjoy. We have two big events coming up in September, The Fall Festival on September 17th, and Living History Days on September 23rd. Make sure to mark both on your calendars.

I want to thank everyone for helping to make things run smoothly within the club activities. We have a great group of people here who are willing to step up and make sure history is preserved for others to enjoy. I have enjoyed being your President, but I have decided to step down as Illiana President to spend time with my young family and enjoy these special moments with them.

Thank you everyone,

***David Hobbs, President***

**Note:** Adam Krichbaum, as our elected Vice President, is currently serving as interim President. The Board is actively evaluating the bylaws to bring forth clarification to the club.

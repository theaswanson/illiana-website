# Fall Festival Recap

## October 7, 2021

Hello to all,

After two years of planning, thinking, organizing and cancelling in 2019, Illiana was able to host its first Craft Show and Swap Meet.
Thank Yous go out to Joan Fry, Kathy Kyle, Adam Krichbaum, and Shawn Byroad for all the work they did to make this event come to be and for its success.

I also want to thank Charlie and Steve and all their railroad buddies for once again bringing all the trains and delivering the visitors around the grounds.
I know there is a lot of work involved in loading, unloading, assembling and maintaining their trains and it is truly appreciated.

The quilting ladies certainly had the Assembly Hall and grounds decorated in a festive fashion.
Thanks goes to Becky Evans and all her helpers in managing the bake sale. Luckily, I purchased the last pie available (apple) and it was delicious!

Illiana is probably the only place where the public gets to enjoy a running steam engine and a miniature model T car thanks to Donnie and Clayton Bodine.

Last and certainly not least, I want to thank the food vendors and all the craft vendors, plus the engine guys who brought merchandise for the swap meet.

I know I'm partial, but I feel that the Illiana showgrounds has one of the prettiest locations to host this type of event.
Once again, Illiana extends a big Thank You to Doug Ransom and Dave Dalton. Doug has graciously donated stone for all our driveways, etc. and Dave is doing the hauling and spreading for us. Thanks, guys.

There will be no October meeting.
We will have our regular November meeting on Monday, November 15.
There will be a Board of Directors meeting at the Assembly Hall on Tuesday, Nov. 9 at 5:30 p.m.

Happy Fall to all. See you in November.

***Tom Swanson, President***

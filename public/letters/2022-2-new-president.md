Hello everyone,

I hope you have had a wonderful winter. I am your new Illiana President, David Hobbs. I am from Crawfordsville. I am married and my wife and I have two children who are both interested in tractors and hit and miss engines as much as I am. I graduated from Purdue and am a Project Engineer for Terra Drive Systems in Brookston. I enjoy restoring tractors and hit and miss engines, and Iâ€™m also interested in any sort of mechanical history.

The summer show will be here before long and I look forward to seeing everyone at the first club meeting of the year on Tuesday, March 15th. We have many different topics to discuss! Our new officer team consists of a few new faces. Adam Krichbaum is the new Vice President, Alan Stutler is our 2nd Vice President, Deb Dye is our new Treasurer, and Amanda Hobbs is our new Secretary.

This year I hope that we will continue to have the great show that we have always had, and I thank all of you in advance for your volunteer efforts to make our show and other special events as extraordinary as they are!

Sincerely,

***David Hobbs, President***

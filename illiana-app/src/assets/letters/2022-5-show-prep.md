# Living History Days, Show Preparations, and Club Happenings

## May 31, 2022

---

Hello everyone, I hope May has treated you well. We had our monthly meeting on May 17th. There was a good turnout despite it being prime farming time for many.

The Living History Days were a huge success! Thank you to all who helped and volunteered their time to make it such a wonderful and memorable day for the 4th graders.

There are still a few items that need done before the show this year. The Jim Eberly building and Post Office need painted, the picnic tables need washed and resealed, and the west half of the milk house needs roofed with tin. Any and all help completing these tasks before the show would be greatly appreciated.

On June 5th, the Hanging Rock Cristian Camp has asked for a few tractors to be represented from 2 pm to 5 pm. If you are interested please let me know so I can contact them.

We are still looking for volunteers to help mow on the weekends. Before the Show in July, we are asking for help getting pie containers to sell pie in the club house. If you are able to help donate pie containers for individual slices please be sure to do so.

We hope to see everyone at the meeting Tuesday, June 21st, the first day of summer. That will be the same week we are set up at the Warren County Fair with a booth in the commercial tent. If you would like to volunteer to work the booth, we still have a few nights available. If you are not working, make sure to stop by and say hello!

Thank you again to everyone for making this one of the best antique power shows in Indiana!

Sincerely,

***David Hobbs, President***

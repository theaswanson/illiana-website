# Assembly Hall Funding & Our President's Final Letter

## January 10, 2022

Hello to everyone,

I sincerely hope you are staying well and free of Covid, although there are several in our club that have had it. It is certainly something to be taken seriously and is a scourge to mankind.

As most everyone knows, in January of 2018, Jim and Doris Manlief gave Illiana $40,000 to finish the new Assembly Hall and did not charge us any interest on the loan, terms and conditions being Illiana was to repay them as soon as possible. Carolyn and I met with them in December to give them some funds from various sources, and in doing so the balance was brought down to $6,000. Needless to say, they informed us that the loan of $40,000 was paid in full. They graciously donated the remaining $6,000 to Illiana and our Assembly Hall is debt-free.

So, as most everyone knows, I've said for the last 3 years that as soon as Illiana paid them back, that I would retire being your president.

Yes, this is my last letter to you to inform you that at last night's directors meeting, January 9th, I informed them that was my last meeting as president. We will be meeting February 1 as a Board of Directors to select new officers for the new year as Doris will also be retiring after 24 years as secretary/treasurer. Jim will no longer be doing the mowing of the grounds.

First, and most important, I thank my wife, Carolyn, for her patience with me all these years of being gone so much. Next, I thank all of you for your support and hard work on behalf of Illiana to make it a family friendly show. I would ask that you all support the new officers and Board of Directors as we begin a new year.

Personally, I felt that between my old age, 80, hard of hearing issues, and my lack of knowledge on modern technology that it is time for new leadership for Illiana. I only wish the best for Illiana in the future. The next club meeting will be in March.

Stay safe and well.

***Tom Swanson, ex-President***

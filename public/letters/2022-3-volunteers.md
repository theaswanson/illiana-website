# Work Day Volunteers Needed

## March 22, 2022

---

Hello everyone,

We had our first club meeting for 2022 on March 15th and had a good turnout. It was a beautiful evening to have a meeting.

We need volunteers to come help clean up the show grounds Saturday, April 2nd starting at 9:00 a.m. There are plenty of leaves and sticks that need cleaned up, so please bring rakes and leaf blowers, and help get the show grounds in shape for the year!

We are really going to need volunteers to mow the grounds this summer, so if you have time, it would be greatly appreciated. There will be a sign-up sheet at the April 19th club meeting. If you are interested in mowing the show grounds a few weekends this year but wonâ€™t be able to make it to the meeting, please feel free to call me at (765) 714-8396 or [email me](mailto:hobbsd92@gmail.com).

Also, the Jim Eberly building and the post office both need to be re-painted before the show this year, and the picnic tables need washed and sealed. We are looking for volunteers to help with these tasks as well.
Thank you again to all who made it to the first meeting of the year and we hope to see everyone at the next meeting Tuesday, April 19th!

Sincerely,

***David Hobbs, President***

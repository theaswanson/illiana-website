# Annual Show Recap

## August 11, 2021

---

Hello to all,

Success in any endeavor is achieved when any one person, or in our case, Illiana, a group of persons, comes together with a common goal in mind; that goal was to put on a great show for the public to enjoy.
Each and every one of you can be proud to say that you had a part in our 2021 show. It seems as though your can-do attitude overcame the damp and muddy conditions in the parking areas.
Saturday and Sunday were very busy with a large attendance. I thank all of you for all the help and your patience. Many times I was told how much people were just enjoying
themselves with visiting old friends and recalling good memories. When you get down to it, that is what our show is all about. It takes a lot of work and effort to put on a show such as ours, but you were equal to the task and I really appreciated it. Welcome to all our new members.

Make plans now to attend or participate in our Fall Craft show and swap meet on Saturday, September 25.

Also, Christmas in the Village will be Friday and Saturday evening, December 4th and 5th.

Once again, thanks for a great show and see you at our August meeting on the 16th.

Tom

# September Update

## September 5, 2021

---

Hello to all,

This extreme summer heat is really drying the corn and beans for an early harvest if it doesn’t let up soon.

It seems as though our nation is in a turmoil between fires, extreme heat, tornadoes and hurricanes.
We extend our sympathies to those families who lost their sons and daughters in Kabul.
It is impossible to bring about a lasting peace to tribal feuding that has been going on for centuries.
Sometimes, it seems as if the networks thrive on delivering had news. It makes you want to turn off the media. Well, enough of my ranting.

I want to thank Terry Faust and family of Williamsport for baling our straw stack. We have approximately 100 square bales of straw for sale. If interested, call me at 765-585-8371.

I’m looking forward to our Craft Fair and Swap Meet on Saturday, Sept. 25. Tell all your friends and neighbors. Come spend the day with us.

Reminder: Board of Directors meeting on Tuesday, Sept. 14 at 6:30. We have several items to discuss.

***Tom Swanson, President***

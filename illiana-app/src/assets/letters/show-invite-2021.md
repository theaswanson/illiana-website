# A Letter From Our President

## June 25, 2021

Show time is almost here, and, on behalf of the Illiana Antique Power Association, I would like to extend an invitation to you to be an exhibitor at our 39th annual show, July 16th, 17th, and 18th. If you have an antique tractor, gas engine, or antique vehicle, we would certainly like for you to bring them for display. They do not have to be restored.

J.I. Case tractors and Ohio MFG. hit & miss engines are featured this year; however, we want all makes and models for display. Also, we extend an invitation to exhibitors of air cooled engines. Sunday, we will feature peddle tractors, so bring the children and grandchildren with their tractors, and they will have their parade! We also have many demonstrations and displays for your enjoyment. Be sure to see the new *Illiana Grain Museum*!

Thank you for your past attendance and patronage. We could not have a show without your exhibits. We are proud of our family-friendly show!

***Tom Swanson, President***

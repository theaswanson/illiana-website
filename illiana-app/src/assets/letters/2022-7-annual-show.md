# 40th Annual Power Show

## July 5, 2022

---

Hello everyone,

We are about a week and a half away from our summer show! We have some new and exciting things we will be trying this year in addition to our normal show activities. We will have classroom sessions all three days. We are still working out the details on this but there will be many different topics including quilting, blacksmithing, In-diana hardwoods, working with pewter, and making new parts for old equipment.

We will also be giving away a gas engine at this year’s show. To enter the giveaway, entrants need to be between the ages of 10-20 years old and be willing to show the engine at Illiana for the next three years. Flywheel Supply out of Iowa has also donated a cart to go with the engine.

We have signs available for purchase to advertise for the show. They are double-sided and may be used year after year. The signs are $10 each.

We will be having a work day on Sunday, July 10th. This will be the closest day to the show that we can work on the grounds before equipment begins arriving!

We look forward to seeing everyone at the show this year and I know it will be a great show as always!

Sincerely,

***David Hobbs, President***

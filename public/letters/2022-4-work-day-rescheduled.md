I hope everyone had a wonderful Easter. As the weather begins to warm up, Iâ€™d like to remind everyone of the rescheduled clean-up day at the showgrounds May 7th at 9:00 am. We hope to have many there to make the cleanup go fast! This will be the weekend before our spring Living History Day which we are very glad to be able to host in person again this year. There will be a few tasks that we need to get completed before the July show. These include painting a few buildings, fixing the roof on the Milk house, and cleaning and sealing the picnic tables. Any help will be tremendously appreciated.

During the April monthly meeting, it was decided that we will have a booth at the Warren County Fair each night the week of June 20-24th from 5-9 p.m. This will be an excellent time to meet with people from the community and advertise for the Association!

I look forward to seeing everyone at the clean-up day, Living History Day, and our next monthly meeting which is on Tuesday, May 17th.

Sincerely,

***David Hobbs, President***

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>ROCKY FORGE AND IBA MEETING
APRIL 18<sup>TH</sup><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After weeks of weather that is conducive to cabin fever,
Mother Nature gave us a great day on April 18<sup>th</sup>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had sunshine, clouds and decent
temperatures for our meeting at Ted Stout’s shop near West Point.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Attendance was above expectations and with
Nathan Allen as the demonstrator, assisted by Clifton Ralph’s comments, we
learned a lot about forging at the anvil compared to the use of a power
hammer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We also got a lot of opinions
about comparison of the air hammer to the mechanical hammer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nathan showed us techniques at both ends of
the spectrum i.e. with the hand hammer at the anvil and then doing the same
operation with the power hammer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He made
a ball and demonstrated the making of a really nice early American drawer pull.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The group participated in discussions between
Nathan and Clifton about die designs with the help of blackboard graphics</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The audience included several new people which we hope will
mail in their membership forms and become partners in our organization.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One visitor was an Amish friend of Ted’s who
has been taking black smithing lessons from him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Ted built a large table<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>forge for him and at the meeting several
members participated in making fire tools for him using his new forge.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nathan made him a coal shovel from a length
of old, pitted, rusty piece of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>4&quot;
by 1/4&quot; iron.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The end result made
all of us envious if the recipient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Three or four guys had set up to do some tail gate sales and
that was fun haggling over bargains.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One
of the vendors was an accomplished copper smith who does a lot of work for Old Williamsburg.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Seeing his work displayed was a real
treat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We even had fresh Amish eggs for
sale.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They didn’t last very long.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Carol cooked some the next day and I thought
she put yellow food coloring in them!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Carol Stout, Joan Ralph, Nancy Redding and Donna Starry put
on a terrific lunch with an abundance of many dishes carried in by the
members.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had to really push some of
those guys out of the basement; they wanted to take a nap!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After lunch we had iron in the hat and took in $210.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was agreed to send the money to our friend
Harold Frost.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Money donated at the end
of the lunch line to offset the cost of the ham was enough that we added it to
the iron in the hat money and we mailed a check to Harold for $300.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thanks to all of you who participated, we
know it will be going directly to the one needing it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Along the same line it is my understanding
that Kim Thomas’s EBAY benefit auction for Harold also made over $300.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>God bless you Kim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the afternoon we all worked outside on the 8 forges Ted had
set up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Several worked with his 100#
Little Giant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Forging activity went into
the later afternoon hours which, paraphrasing Martha<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stewart, was a good thing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was lots of friendship forged that day
with camaraderie in the air.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Needless to
say, I<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>believe this was one of those
memorable meetings that I will never forget and trust that everyone else had a
great time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Carol and I thank all of you
for making it such a good day.<span

<p class=MsoNormal>Man, where do I start?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There has been so much activity on the ol’ P.C.&amp;W. of late that I
don’t know what to tell you first!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Oh
well, here goes: Howard and Virginia Snider, Tom Swanson, Bob Folk, Terry
Bodine and Art Petty made a “brick<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>run”
and supplied three truckloads of pavers for the new waiting station, which were
then neatly laid by Marty LaFoe into a great looking platform.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That being said, we still need 600 more!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Keep looking everyone!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now when Tom Swanson says he wants to get
involved with something, he means it!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Practically every shingle on that new roof bears Tom’s finger prints,
along with Bob Folk and Art Petty, it was “Topped Out” with the final addition
of that great old tin ridge cap from the recent building demolition.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thank you all so much once again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the Saturday preceding History Day, a mighty group
gathered to get the track “Up to Snuff” for Monday’s activities.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This bunch of “Gandy Dancers” consisted of
Don Bodine, track boss, who spent the entire day on his butt, and was
constantly reminded of it by every passer-by, Larry Sturgeon, Art Petty, Terry
Bodine, Bob Folk and your truly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Don was
a brutal task-master but his constant whip lashes got the whole track re-tamped

</span>Steve Dye and your truly made up the crew of the “Pine Creek Express”,
followed closely by a much needed “special train” consisting of Don Evan’s
beautiful electric lash-up, and Clayton Bodine’s “Jolly Trolley”, piloted by
the man himself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This spurious bunch
managed to haul almost 300 school kids, teachers and supporting parents around
the grounds with out so much as a skinned knuckle!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, this is probably due to the great
station crew we had, which consisted of Rolland and Alice McKinney, Christy

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Time changes many things even
the landscape.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I remember traveling
Hwy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>41 as a little girl.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don’t mean the 41 of today....I mean the “old
41.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Old 41 as it was then only exists
in patches here and there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I remember a <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>narrow two lane highway that curved and dipped
constantly between Lake County and Nashville, Tn., before Mom switched to Hwy
31 on her way to Birmingham.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many years
ago there on Old 41, there was a store that stood just north of Carbondale at
Briscoe Corners.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a unique place
owned by Jim Marquess and his wife Helen.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jim and Helen kept the store open seven days a week from sun-up until
dusk.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the 1930's Briscoe Corners was
a center of activity up until World War II.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There was a baseball diamond in the back of the store and a local team
took on all comers in softball or hardball.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>On the wall of the old store hung a placard that advertised a boxing
program that was staged as a Labor Day Extravaganza in the 1940's.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Store was a real “Jot ‘em down store”,
with everything from hog feed, steaks or fan belts.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On Sunday nights a movie was shown on the
side of the building.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jim Marquess and
his wife Helen lived next door to the store.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>At the time, there was about 50-60 people that lived up and down Old
41.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the death of his wife, Jim
still opened the store but also closed it anytime the mood struck him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His constant companion was an Irish setter
named Bob.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A lazy house cat usually
slept amidst the clutter of papers on the counter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The shelves were empty of goods; instead they
held odds and ends, curios and crude carvings that Jim chopped out of
wood.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A sign on the side of the store
read “Briscoe, since 1856&quot;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is
believed that Briscoe was much older than that but the fact couldn’t be established
since records in the Warren County Court House were destroyed by fire in
1856.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The store was once a one-room
school house that had been abandoned in 1929.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jim bought the building and a half-acre of land and turned it into a
store.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jim liked to tell the story of
the time when John Dillinger stopped at the store.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“John Dillinger sat right out there once”, as
he pointed out at the gas pumps through a dusty front window.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“I think it was 1932 or maybe ‘33&quot;, he
continued.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“He didn’t come into the store,
but a couple of the other men did, and they bought some food.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn’t find out Dillinger was in the car
until later.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jim was a collector of
oddities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some of the things he
collected were the 44,000 fired shotgun primers from his years of reloading for
trap shooting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a ball of twine
that hung from the wood shelf at the right of the store.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jim said that there was 25 miles of twine -
enough to reach Danville, Il.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and a
third of the way back.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He would add
another 15 miles to it that winter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jim
was a man that just couldn’t sit still...he had to be doing something.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>There is no sign of Jim’s store, the ball of
twine, the baseball diamond or any other signs of the past there now.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just the memories of the people in the area
keep Jim’s memory alive!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is “no-way” we could have ordered a nicer day than the
one Mother Nature supplied us with for the 6th Annual History Day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Earlier weather reports predicted rain, but
our day started out with lovely blue skies, sunshine and of course a “little
wind” that this area is noted for.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A school bus from Attica was first to arrive just before
9:00 A.M. with two buses from Covington following shortly.<span

Finny Filchak was once again “Mr.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

McKinney, Clayton Bodine, Anne Bodine and Christy Dunbar helped load and
un-load students and pass out souvenir tickets and Polar Express bells.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Later in the day, Clayton added his “Jolly
Trolley” to the tracks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It’s the newest
addition to the railroad that Don and Terry Bodine built during the winter
months, but for safety reasons, the only passenger that day was Jim Petty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>THE DULCIMER GROUP:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>Donna Starry, Herb and Betty Pigman, Julie Poor and Lois Miller
entertained the students with some lovely music.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everyone joined in singing several songs, clapping
time with the music and had the old fashion wooden puppets dancing to the
tunes!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We even discovered that Rolland McKinney plays a dulcimer
and with much urging, played a couple songs between student groups.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BLACKSMITH STATION:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

Clark Expedition.</p>

and butter crocks were on display.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
also made butter shaking small jars of cream and the butter was then used in
the club house to taste on the corn bread.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two buses from Southeast Fountain Elementary arrived just
after Attica and Covington buses pulled away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>All the students from the school had on matching blue T-shirts.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seems that this year, the school was able
to get some grant money and schedule several field trips for their fourth
graders.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each field trip was printed on
the shirt (Illiana’s included) and the students wore them on their trips.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This made it easy to identify their students
when other schools were involved.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Great
idea!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were fortunate to have news
coverage from the Danville Commercial News and The Fountain County Neighbor
newspapers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Art Petty received a
generous check for $600.00 from a representative from Tipmont<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>REMC.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We received a grant from their “Operation Round-up” Program.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thank you REMC!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the buses pulled away, everyone
gathered by the clubhouse to enjoy a delicious meal of ham and bean that Ted
Stout had cooking by the blacksmith building.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Joan Fry had some “sandwich fixings” and side dishes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Topping off the meal were some tasty cakes
supplied by Joan and Carol Stout.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>M-M-M-Good food again!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Clean up was soon under way with everyone pitching in.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We’d like to thank everyone who helped on the
week-end to get the clubhouse and grounds ready, for all the help throughout
the History Day and for all the help cleaning up!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We also want to thank all the ladies who
“sewed their hearts out” making the souvenir bags!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But, most of all: Thanks Art Petty and Joan
Fry who organized this whole event!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>If
by chance I have missed some one who worked and was not mentioned, I apologize,
as it was not intentional.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One last
note: It was nice to see a gathering of members who camped the week-end.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It looked like they had a good time!</p>

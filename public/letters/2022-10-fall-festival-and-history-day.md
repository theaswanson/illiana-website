A HUGE thank you to Kathy Kyle for organizing the Fall Festival! It was a great success! A nice variety of venders, delicious food, and baked goods were available! The weather was wonderful and the crowd was steady! Everyone seemed to enjoy the day.

History days went off as planned! A big thank you to everyone who worked so hard before hand to get the grounds ready! Thank you to the men who drove the people movers. Thank you also to the people who demonstrated a past skill! The trains were a big hit as usual! The last I heard we entertained 375 school children and many accompanying adults. We saw many happy faces! Thank you to the quilters who made each student a bag to collect
their treasures in. A HUGE thank you to Joan Fry for organizing the day!

Our next meeting will be held Tuesday, October 18th at 6:30 in the assembly hall. Christmas in the Village will be here before we know it. We need to discuss these details that evening! Please bring a covered dish to share. I look forward to seeing you there!

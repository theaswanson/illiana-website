          History Day is a living history presentation by the Illiana Antique Power Association for 4th grade students
          in the West-Central Indiana region where children can have hands-on experience, as well as watch
          demonstrations by club members.
          This has been a very popular event for many years with an emphasis on Indiana history.

        <p>
          For those who cannot attend in-person, we have created several online videos for you to watch at your own pace
          to learn about key areas of our early ways of life, ranging from the Post Office and Sawmill to the Printing
          Press and Blacksmithing.
          Each video was filmed on location at the showgrounds by members of our club. If you enjoy what you see, come
          visit us at one of our next events!

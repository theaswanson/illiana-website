Greetings!

I hope everyone had a great time at our annual show this weekend. We had a wonderful turnout, and it was great seeing everyone again.

Our very first Fall Festival is quickly approaching! We are inviting crafters, quilters, iron enthusiasts, engine swappers, and train collectors to come and share their craft with us. We will have food vendors on the grounds, and camping spots are available.

Mark your calendars for Saturday, September 25 from 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM.

If you are interested in participating as a vendor, check out our [Fall Festival page](/fall-festival) for the vendor application. The deadline to apply as a vendor is **August 1**. Additional event details and contact information are also available on that page.

Please join us for a fun-filled day! We hope to see you there.

***Adam Swanson, Webmaster***
